Assumption: This Generative AI project/tool saves 2 hours per employee per week. Math: 1,000 employees x 2 hours x $50/hour = $5M annual savings. Conclusion: The project pays for itself in 3 months. This logic is dangerously flawed. It is a "spreadsheet hallucination." In reality, saving 10% of 100 people's time does not result in 10 fewer employees, it results in 100 people who are 10% less stressed or who spend that time on other non-monetary tasks. Unless you are planning mass layoffs (which carry their own massive hidden costs) "time saved" rarely translates to "cash banked." We must stop justifying AI projects based on Labor Savings (Efficiency) and start justifying them based on New Capabilities (Expansion). The trillions of dollars in value will not come from writing emails faster, it will come from unlocking services, insights and products that were previously economically impossible.
