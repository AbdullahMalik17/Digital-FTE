Hi,

For a long time, UX Pilot has been a tool you use daily. More recently, we have been studying a new first step toward making it a platform you can build on.

It’s been quietly testing so far through a few partners, but today we are ripping the band-aid off.

Multiple API Access for Teams and Enterprise.

This is a massive unlock. You can now programmatically integrate UX Pilot’s generation engine directly into your own internal dashboards, product requirement tools, or ticketing systems.

What can you actually build?

We know that for our Enterprise partners, governance comes first. You need to control who can automate what.

We added a dedicated "Master Switch" for Super Admins.

You can now toggle API access on or off globally for your entire organization directly from the Enterprise Management Portal.

This ensures that no data leaves your environment via API unless you explicitly allow it.

You get full programmatic access to the exact same engines that power the editor.

Whether you are generating screens or utilizing our advanced reasoning models, you can now drive the engine via API to build rich, automated integrations with access to most existing UX Pilot Features.
* ﻿Ingest Context: Automatically attach project requirements, documents, images, and even sticky notes to a project context via the API.
* Automate Flows: Trigger the creation of full User Flows (Wireframe or HiFi) based on external data triggers.
* Sync Requirements: Connect your PM tools to automatically seed a design session with the right specs before a designer even opens the file.

Ready to automate your design ops? Click the button below and upgrade to a Team/Enterprise plan today or if you already on those just schedulle a chat to unlock the API and start building your own integrations
